I think of this name mostly because I've heard of the song itself by Seals & Crofts, the tune is actually pretty popular, I guess you'll realize it easily:

**Summer Breeze**
_Seals & Crofts_
```
See the curtains hangin' in the window
In the evening on a Friday night
A little light-a-shinin' through the window
Lets me know everything's all right

Summer breeze makes me feel fine
Blowin' through the jasmine in my mind
Summer breeze makes me feel fine
Blowin' though the jasmine in my mind

See the paper layin' on the sidewalk
A little music from the house next door
So I walk on up to the doorstep
Through the screen and across the floor

Summer breeze makes me feel fine
Blowin' through the jasmine in my mind
Summer breeze makes me feel fine
Blowin' through the jasmine in my mind

Sweet days of summer
The jasmine's in bloom
July is dressed up and playing her tune
And I come home from a hard day's work
And you're waitin' there, not a care in the world
See the smile awaitin' in the kitchen
Food's cookin' and the plates for two
Feel the arms that reach out to hold me
In the evening when the day is through

Summer breeze makes me feel fine
Blowing through the jasmine in my mind
Summer breeze makes me feel fine
Blowing through the jasmine in my mind

I suppose this is the place where I can write whatever I want, for no particular reason, at least for now.

Summer breeze makes me feel fine.

And I hope to you, it'll bring some fresh finds, like a cool breeze that slightly winding across your face. 

Cheers,
